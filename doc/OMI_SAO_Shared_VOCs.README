OMI_SAO_Shared_VOCs contains the shared source code and static input files
for three SAO OMI PGEs OMHCHO, OMCHOCHO and OMH2O. It is not a PGE by itself.
OMI_SAO_Shared_VOCs must be checked out prior to PGE compilation, and must be 
added to doc/ciList.txt of these three PGEs. Be careful, different versions
of OMI_SAO_Shared_VOCs work for different PGEs. For example for OMH2O you
should use version 1.0.6 but for OMHCHO 1.0.4. These numbers will
obviously change over time.
